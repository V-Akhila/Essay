* Programming is an art that requires creativity, patience, lateral thinking and accuracy as foundations to be successful. I am a medical graduate from India. My husband and brother are software engineers and I am always fascinated on how innovative their work is. I worked as a research intern in a Transplant center in Seattle, where, I realized the importance of programming in medical research. The way knowledge of programming helped in analyzing the clinical and laboratory data in clinical and basic science research and its interpretation helped us to decide the future direction of the research. I was fascinated towards the role of data scientists in research and wanted to pursue a course in programming. I took an online course in Coursera on fundamentals of programming that taught me the fundamentals of Python programming. This course made me realize how fun programming can be. Later I leant basics of R programming through online resources. I decided to give GRE and TOEFEL to be able to apply to masters in data-science or similar programs and currently preparing for them.

* If accepted into the program, In 5 years, I would love to see myself as a Big-Data scientist in cancer research institution. I believe that by combining my knowledge in medicine and programming I could be of help in studies of finding better cure and rehabilitation methods for cancer patients.

* I appreciate the mission of Ada Developers Academy in providing women and people with no programming background a platform to pursue their interest in software and unleash their programming skills. I, myself being a woman with no software knowledge struggling to find a job and unable to think of masters program due to financial constraints, appreciate the effort of the academy. I would contribute to Adaâ€™s vision by increasing the awareness about the importance of having diversity and inclusivity in the software industry in my work and social communities. I plan to donate to the Ada academy and attend volunteer orientation classes. I am a good listener and observer and this combined with my medical background, I would love to volunteer as an Adie mentor whenever possible.
